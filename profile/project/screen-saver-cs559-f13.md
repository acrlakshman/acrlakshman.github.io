My project for the course CS559 ‘Computer Graphics‘ taught by Perry Kivolowitz in the Fall of 2013. Unlike other projects, source code for this one is not provided, since my code is not properly organized. However for interested students I would encourage to visit one of my friends [Hammad Mazhar] github repository, where he may be uploading his project files for the same course. As of now, he has uploaded “camera” class which is also used by me in this project.

Below is the screencast of my project [caution: reduce volume before playing] and the windows executable along with shaders and readme file can be found [here](cs559/project.zip "file").

Note: This project was completed in a hurry, hence is not at all organized. I will try to upload properly written shaders as well as separate class files for shaders, frame buffer objects, mouse, camera, etc.

*Edit: Please visit [Basic Model Viewer] page for properly organized class files and for other updates.*
