(There exists both opensource and commercial utilities that does this job, however they heavily concentrate on visualizing the scene with inhouse tools and still lack in providing compatibility with other packages.)\\n* Visualize objects that are defined in standard formats like Wavefront OBJ, PLY etc.\\n* Open source, easy to understand and also act as a learning platform for computer graphics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### Motivation\\n\\nWhile rendering results obtained from [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com/) using [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/), I observed the trouble that my friends faced in deciding the camera settings and material properties. Apart from this, the route that we have taken to generate POV-Ray compatible files, which is via [EnSight](https://www.ansys.com/products/fluids/ansys-ensight). Though Basic Model Viewer is not yet fully equipped to address all these issues, I have made some progress along with completing some useful functionalities which can come handy for photo-realistic rendering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### Basic usage\\n\\nThe following demo is aimed to kick-start a user in using this application in their work with some basic tools.\\n\\n_Installation_\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/acrlakshman/BasicModelViewer.git BasicModelViewer\\ncd BasicModelViewer\\nmkdir build\\ncd build\\nqmake ..\\nmake\\n```\\n\\n_Demo_\\n\\nCurrently GUI for _Basic Model Viewer_ is not complete, hence for the time being `RenderScene.cpp` & `RenderScene.h` are provided to render a scene. This essentially forces user to write code for what he is looking to visualize.\\n\\n* Initialize the RenderObj object as follows in the function `InitializeScene`\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  if (!this->render_obj.LocalInitialize(\\"../Resources/cubehandle0fix.obj\\"))\\n    return false;\\n  ```\\n\\n  Assuming the object of RenderObj is called in the Draw function, the following scene is being rendered in the graphics window (zoom towards the object by scrolling mouse wheel)\\n\\n  ![cubehandle](bmv/cubehandle_1.png)\\n  _Thanks to [Pradeep Garigipati] for providing OBJ file of this object_\\n\\n* To get the camera details, _`press c on the keyboard`_, this saves the details in a file `scene_details.txt` in the parent directory. Sample output is as follows\\n\\n  ```sh\\n  Camera details (Right handed system)\\n  Camera position: (36.402737, 41.488392, 30.879433)\\n  Camera look at: (0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)\\n  Camera up vector: (-0.493296, 0.754725, -0.432489)\\n  Camera field of view: 23.000000\\n\\n  Camera details (Left handed system)\\n  Camera position: (36.402737, 41.488392, -30.879433)\\n  Camera look at: (0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)\\n  Camera up vector: (-0.493296, 0.754725, 0.432489)\\n  Camera field of view: 23.000000\\n\\n  Light details (Right handed system)\\n  Light position: (0.000000, 0.000000, 10.000000)\\n\\n  Light details (Left handed system)\\n  Light position: (0.000000, 0.000000, -10.000000)\\n  ```\\n\\n* To show the surface mesh of the object (wireframe), update the `InitializeScene` function as follows\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  if (!this->render_obj.LocalInitialize(\\"../Resources/cubehandle0fix.obj\\"))\\n    return false;\\n  this->render_obj.show_wire_frame(true);\\n  ```\\n\\n  ![cubehandle](bmv/cubehandle_2.png)\\n  _wireframe mode_\\n\\n* Let us show the normals on the surface mesh of the object, by updating the `InitializeScene` function as follows\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  if (!this->render_obj.LocalInitialize(\\"../Resources/cubehandle0fix.obj\\"))\\n    return false;\\n  this->render_obj.show_wire_frame(true);\\n  this->render_obj.show_normals(true);\\n  ```\\n\\n  ![cubehandle](bmv/cubehandle_3.png)\\n  _Object in wireframe mode with normals_\\n\\n  > Note: Normals do not scale properly with the object dimensions. Hence for now, in case of the objects with small dimensional values, user needs to manually edit the size of normals (e.g. Change the value of `normal_scalar` in `GenericObject.cpp`)\\n\\n* The following modification shows two objects with different light settings\\n\\n  In `InitializeScene` function:\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  if (!this->cubehandle_obj.LocalInitialize(\\"../Resources/cubehandle0fix.obj\\"))\\n    return false;\\n  this->cubehandle_obj.show_wire_frame(false);\\n  this->cubehandle_obj.show_normals(false);\\n\\n  if (!this->teapot_obj.LocalInitialize(\\"../Resources/teapot.obj\\"))\\n    return false;\\n\\n  Light light_for_teapot;\\n  light_for_teapot.position = QVector3D(0.0, 0.0, 10.0);\\n  light_for_teapot.color_ambient = QVector3D(0.75, 0.6, 0.5);\\n  light_for_teapot.color_diffuse = QVector3D(0.75, 0.6, 0.5);\\n  light_for_teapot.color_specular = QVector3D(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\\n\\n  this->teapot_obj.EditLight(light_for_teapot);\\n\\n  this->teapot_obj.show_wire_frame(false);\\n  this->teapot_obj.show_normals(false);\\n  ```\\n\\n  In `Draw` function\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  if (!this->cubehandle_obj.Draw(projection, modelview_cam, modelview, shader_))\\n    return false;\\n\\n  modelview.translate(QVector3D(5.0, 5.0,-2.0));\\n  if (!this->teapot_obj.Draw(projection, modelview_cam, modelview, shader_))\\n    return false;\\n  ```\\n\\n  In `TakeDown` function\\n\\n  ```cpp\\n  this->cubehandle_obj.TakeDown();\\n  this->teapot_obj.TakeDown();\\n  ```\\n\\n  ![cubehandle](bmv/cubehandle_teapot.png)\\n\\n* Some default shaders are available in the folder `Shaders`.\\n* Texture mapping is under development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### Acknowledgements\\n\\n* [Hammad Mazhar] both for helping me to understand the basics of computer graphics and for providing his camera class, the basic functionalities of which are used in this project.\\n* [Syoyo Fujita] for his obj file loader, which I got through Hammad.\\n* [Pradeep Garigipati] for providing sample obj files.\\n* [Andrew Seidl]\\n\\n[Pradeep Garigipati]: https://pradeepgarigipati.com/\\n[Hammad Mazhar]: https://github.com/hmazhar\\n[Syoyo Fujita]: https://github.com/syoyo\\n[Andrew Seidl]: https://github.com/andrewseidl"}},"render":true},{"value":{"name":"Weak Formulation of Gradient Augmented Level Set Method to Stephan Type Problems","description":"This was my final project for [Prof. Eftychios Sifakis\'s](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis) course [CS838](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/courses/cs838-f12/) (_Advanced Modelling and Simulation_) (Fall-2012).  \\n *Video along with the related files are included*","team":"_Lakshman Anumolu_","note":"","thumbnail":"crystal_growth_t.png","highlights":[{"brief":"","detail":"3D Crystal growth simulated using PhysBAM"}],"keywords":["PhysBAM"],"startDate":"2012","endDate":"2012","url":"https://lakshmananumolu.com/project/crystal-growth","webPage":{"slug":"crystal-growth","detail":"My project for the course [CS838](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/courses/cs838-f12/) (_Advanced Modeling and Simulation_) taught by [Prof. Eftychios Sifakis] in the Fall of 2012.
